# Calculators made with Python

Three calculators made with Python. First lab for COP3502.

## Result

```python
#Intersections
Enter m for line 1: 3
Enter b for line 1: 8
Enter m for line 2: 6
Enter b for line 2: 0
The intersection point is (2.67,16.0)

#Rectangles
Enter the length: 6
Enter the width: 2
Rectangle perimeter:  16.0 
Rectangle area:  12.0
Rectangle diagonal:  6.32

#Resistance
What is the value of R1? 6
What is the value of R2? 7
What is the value of R3? 8
The equivalent resistance is 2.3 ohms
```
